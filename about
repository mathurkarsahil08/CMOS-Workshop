# CMOS Workshop

This repository contains resources and documentation for the CMOS Workshop, focusing on CMOS circuit design and simulation using Cadence tools. It includes step-by-step guides, layouts, and simulation outputs for CMOS-based circuits like inverters and NAND gates.

## Overview of CMOS

**CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)** is a technology used for constructing integrated circuits, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology utilizes both **NMOS** and **PMOS** transistors to achieve high efficiency, low power consumption, and scalability. Key features include:
- Low static power dissipation.
- High noise immunity.
- High density of logic functions on a chip.

### Key Concepts in This Workshop:
1. **CMOS Inverter Design**:
   - Understand the operation of CMOS inverters using NMOS and PMOS transistors.
   - Simulate the output waveform for an inverter circuit.

2. **NAND Gate Using CMOS**:
   - Design the layout and schematic for a NAND gate.
   - Analyze its operation and waveform behavior.

3. **Voltage Source Configuration**:
   - Use VPulse for providing the necessary input signals to the circuits.
